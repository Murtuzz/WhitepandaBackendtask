Car Rental System

I have used the following dependencies :
   'body-parser, express, mongoose, morgan, nodemon'.
    
    I have used amazon AWS as a cloud and MongoDB as the database, I directly access the Atlas Mongodb for restful API.
  there are 5 API :
get all, get a specific category car,  post car, update a car, delete a car.
API's are in route, the database schema is in Post file.
data is sent through a JSON object.
